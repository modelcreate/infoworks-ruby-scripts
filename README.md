## List of scripts

### Simple

If you are a beginner and just learning Ruby these scripts can be used as a reference to learn how to automate simple tasks.

Each of these scripts will only complete a single task and the code within will be commented to provide context for those not familiar with coding in Ruby.

### Intermediate

Intermediate scripts attempt to automate realistic modelling tasks using Ruby. These scripts will contain multiple tasks that flow from each other. High-level comments are provided, though some experience with coding would be expected to modify or extend the scripts.

Config variables are generally added to the top of the script to allow some level of customisation and running the scripts directly by the end-user with minimal modification.
